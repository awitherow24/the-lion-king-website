                <p>The Lion King features a star-studded cast that brings the beloved characters to life with their
                    memorable performances. Matthew Broderick voices the adult Simba, capturing the character's journey
                    from a carefree cub to a responsible king. James Earl Jones delivers a powerful performance as
                    Mufasa, Simba's wise and noble father. Jeremy Irons portrays the cunning and villainous Scar, adding
                    depth to the character's malevolence. Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella provide comic relief as Timon
                    and Pumbaa, the lovable meerkat and warthog duo. The film also features the voices of Moira Kelly as
                    Nala, Simba's childhood friend and eventual queen, and Rowan Atkinson as Zazu, the uptight hornbill
                    advisor. The ensemble cast's dynamic performances contribute significantly to the film's enduring
                    appeal and emotional resonance.</p>
